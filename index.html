                Personal Information Extractors can identify you through facial recognition, voice recognition, and
                behavior fingerprints. 
                They build a profile on you and serve you ads on the streets. Our AI is configured to
                block these trackers.

            <h2> Where You Go<br>Says A Lot About You </h2>
            <p>
                We don’t associate your location with your identity. Personal information such as saved locations and
                routes stay on your BioChip and are not broadcasted to PIEs.

            <h2> What You Say<br>Should Not Be Public </h2>
            <p>
                AI conversations are kept secure on your BioChip and data is only broadcasted anonymously for the
                purpose of
                improving our services. All outgoing voice audio is stripped of identifying attributes through the use
                of audio distortion algorithms.

            <p>
                What you buy, where you bought it, and how much you paid is sensitive information. We don’t store, sell,
                or use that information. Your spending history never leaves your BioChip.

            <p>
                From your heart rate to your reproductive cycle, apps for your health can give you insight into some of
                your most personal details. We let you take control of what information your BioChip collects, doesn’t
                collect,
                and who has access to it.
