        <p>
            Personal Information Extractors can identify you through facial recognition, voice recognition, and behavior
            fingerprints. They build a profile on you and serve you ads on the streets. Our AI is configured to block
            these
            trackers.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Where You Go Says A Lot About You
        </h2>

        <p>
            We don’t associate your location with your identity. Personal information such as saved locations and routes
            stay on
            your BioChip and are not broadcasted to PIEs.
        </p>

        <h2>
            What You Say Should Not Be Public
        </h2>

        <p>
            AI conversations are kept secure on your BioChip and data is only broadcasted anonymously for the purpose of
            improving our services. All outgoing voice audio is stripped of identifying attributes through the use of
            audio
            distortion algorithms.
        </p>

            Keep Your Financials Private
        </h2>

        <p>
            What you buy, where you bought it, and how much you paid is sensitive information. We don’t store, sell, or
            use
            that
            information. Your spending history never leaves your BioChip.

        <p>
            From your heart rate to your reproductive cycle, apps for your health can give you insight into some of your
            most
            personal details. We let you take control of what information your BioChip collects, doesn’t collect, and
            who
            has
            access to it.
